# Kujira

[What does Jira mean](https://confluence.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=223219957)?
The name Kujira was chosen in jest because it means `whale`. When in reality it is intended to be very small and
lightweight.

### What it is

Command Line Interface application that is used to retrieve [Jira](https://jira.atlassian.com/) details without using
the [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) provided web interface.

### Why?

Because I hate having to pay my ISP for downloading shiney UI elements when all I need is to update or read a Jira
description, or look at my current [kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development))
or [scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) board.

### How use?

I don't know, I haven't figured it out yet.
